# 🎮 A Very Interesting Game — Built in C with SDL2

A fun and interactive 2D game developed in pure C using the SDL2 library. This project demonstrates real-time rendering, event handling, animations, and game logic — all built from scratch with a clean and modular architecture.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Real-time input handling (keyboard/mouse)
- 🧠 Game logic with multiple states (menu, gameplay, pause, etc.)
- 🔊 Audio integration (optional)
- 🖼️ Textures, sprites, and smooth animations
- ⏱️ Frame rate control and timer logic
- 🔁 Replayable, simple yet addictive gameplay

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **C** (Core Language)
- **SDL2** (Graphics, Input, Timing)
- Optional: `SDL_image`, `SDL_ttf`, `SDL_mixer` for extended functionality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have SDL2 installed. You can install it using:

#### On Linux (Debian-based):
```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
